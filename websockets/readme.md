# Zensockets

## Setup

First you'll need to clone the repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sh1ps/zensockets.git

Once you have the source, rename `config.js.example` to `config.js` and modify the contents for yourself. The Zencoder API key included in the example is integration only, so it will work to create test jobs.

    $ cd zensockets
    $ npm install
    $ node app
